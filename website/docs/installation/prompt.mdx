:::tip If you have no idea which shell you're currently using, Oh My Posh has a
utility switch that can tell that to you. :::

```sh
oh-my-posh get shell
```

<Tabs
  defaultValue="powershell"
  groupId="shell"
  values={[
    { label: 'bash', value: 'bash', },
    { label: 'cmd', value: 'cmd', },
    { label: 'elvish', value: 'elvish', },
    { label: 'fish', value: 'fish', },
    { label: 'nu', value: 'nu', },
    { label: 'powershell', value: 'powershell', },
    { label: 'tcsh', value: 'tcsh', },
    { label: 'xonsh', value: 'xonsh', },
    { label: 'zsh', value: 'zsh', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

Add the following to `~/.bashrc` (could be `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`
depending on your environment):

```sh
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash)"
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec bash
```

Or, when using `~/.profile`.

```sh
. ~/.profile
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cmd">

There's no out-of-the-box support for Windows CMD when it comes to custom
prompts. There is however a way to do it using [Clink][clink], which at the same
time supercharges your cmd experience. Follow the installation instructions and
make sure you select autostart.

Integrating Oh My Posh with Clink is easy: create a new file called
oh-my-posh.lua in your Clink scripts directory (run `clink info` inside cmd to
find that file's location).

```lua title="oh-my-posh.lua"
load(io.popen('oh-my-posh init cmd'):read("*a"))()
```

Once added, restart cmd for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="elvish">

Add the following at the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```sh
eval (oh-my-posh init elvish)
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec elvish
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fish">

:::caution Oh My Posh requires fish v3.4.0 or higher. :::

Initialize Oh My Posh in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```sh
oh-my-posh init fish | source
```

Once added, reload your config for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec fish
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nu">

:::caution Oh My Posh requires Nushell v0.86.0 or higher. :::

Add the following line to the Nushell env file (`$nu.env-path`):

```sh
oh-my-posh init nu
```

This saves the initialization script to `~/.oh-my-posh.nu`. Now, edit the
Nushell config file (`$nu.config-path`) and add the following line at the
bottom:

```sh
source ~/.oh-my-posh.nu
```

If you want to save the initialization script elsewhere, you can change the
first line to something like this:

```sh
oh-my-posh init nu --print | save /mylocation/myscript.nu --force
```

And change the `source` line to:

```sh
source /mylocation/myscript.nu
```

Once added, restart Nushell for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

Edit your PowerShell profile script, you can find its location under the
`$PROFILE` variable in your preferred PowerShell version. For example, using
notepad:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

:::info When the above command gives an error, make sure to create the profile
first.

```powershell
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```

In this scenario, it can also be that PowerShell blocks running local scripts.
To solve that, set PowerShell to only require remote scripts to be signed using
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine`, or
[sign the profile][sign]. :::

Then add the following line.

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression
```

:::tip Antivirus software If adding an exception to your Antivirus software
still blocks Oh My Posh for Windows, you can try using the below alternate line
in your PowerShell profile. This is a drop-in replacement to the above call with
Invoke-Expression. Tested with PowerShell 7.2.4 with Bitdefender Antivirus
installed and requires NO exceptions for oh-my-posh.exe. Bitdefender blocks the
calls to Invoke-Expression as malicious code and this alternate line skips the
double calls:

```powershell
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\jandedobbeleer.omp.json" --print) -join "`n"))
```

:::

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tcsh">

Add the following at the end of `~/.tcshrc`:

```sh
eval $(oh-my-posh init tcsh)
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec tcsh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="xonsh">

Add the following line at the end of `~/.xonshrc`:

```sh
execx($(oh-my-posh init xonsh))
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec xonsh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="zsh">

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"
```

:::tip As the standard terminal has issues displaying the ANSI characters
correctly, you might want to skip loading just for that terminal and instead of
the line above, place this in your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
if [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "Apple_Terminal" ]; then
	eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"
fi
```

Note this will still load Oh My Posh for [iTerm2][iterm2] or any other modern
day macOS terminal that supports ANSI characters. :::

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```sh
exec zsh
```
